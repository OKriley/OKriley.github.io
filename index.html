            <h2>The Guardian</h2>
            <p>"I was utterly absorbed by this movie’s simple storytelling verve and the terrific lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who are both excellent – particularly Stone, who has never been better." -- Peter Bradshaw</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>The Hollywood Reporter</h2>
            <p>"For Chazelle to be able to pull this off the way he has is something close to remarkable. The director's feel for a classic but, for all intents and purposes, discarded genre format is instinctive and intense." -- Todd McCarthy</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Rolling Stone</h2>
            <p>"What makes La La Land such a hot miracle is how the passion for cinema and its possibilities radiates from every frame." -- Peter Travers</p>

<blockquote cite="https://griffithobservatory.org/about/observatory-history/">
    Since the doors opened in 1935, Griffith Observatory has become the most-visited public observatory in the world. The Observatory’s history starts with the vision of one man and reflects the invention, innovation, and inspiration that also characterize Los Angeles.
